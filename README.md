Rotate Two-Dimensional Arrays of uniform size (matrices) 90° forward, useful for fixing programs that confuse programming with mathematics.

## Example


```JavaScript

//input
[ [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ] ]

```

```JavaScript

//output (rotated 90°)
[ [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 1, 1, 1, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 1, 1, 1 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 1, 1, 1, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 1, 1, 1 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ] ]

```
